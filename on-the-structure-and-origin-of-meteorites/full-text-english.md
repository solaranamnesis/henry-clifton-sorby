# On the Structure and Origin of Meteorites.

## Abstract of lecture delivered by H. C. Sorby, F. R. S., _etc._, at the Museum, South Kensington, on March 10, 1877.

The study of meteorites is naturally divisible into several very distinct branches of inquiry. Thus in the first place we may regard them as shooting stars, and observe and discuss their radiant points and their relation to the solar system. This may be called the astronomical aspect of the question. Then, when solid masses fall to the ground, we may study their chemical composition as a whole, or that of the separate mineral constituents; and lastly, we may study their mechanical structure, and apply to this investigation
