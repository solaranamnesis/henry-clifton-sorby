# On the Structure and Origin of Meteorites.

## Abstract of lecture delivered by H. C. Sorby, F. R. S., _etc._, at the Museum, South Kensington, on March 10, 1877.

The study of meteorites is naturally divisible into several very distinct branches of inquiry. Thus in the first place we may regard them as shooting stars, and observe and discuss their radiant points and their relation to the solar system. This may be called the astronomical aspect of the question. Then, when solid masses fall to the ground, we may study their chemical composition as a whole, or that of the separate mineral constituents; and lastly, we may study their mechanical structure, and apply to this investigation the same methods which have yielded such important results in the case of terrestrial rocks. So much has been written on the astronomical, chemical, and mineralogical aspect of my subject by those far more competent than myself to deal with such questions, that I shall confine my remarks almost entirely to the mechanical structure of meteorites and meteoric irons, and more especially to my own observations, since they will, at all events, have the merit of greater originality and novelty. Time will, however, not permit me to enter into the detail even of this single department of my subject.

In treating this question it appeared to me very desirable to exhibit to you accurate reproductions of the natural objects, and I have therefore had prepared photographs of my original drawings, which we shall endeavour to show by means of the oxyhydrogen lime-light, and I shall modify my lecture to meet the requirements of the case, exhibiting and describing special examples, rather than attempt to give an account of meteorites in general. Moreover, since the time at my disposal is short, and their external characters may be studied to great advantage at the British Museum, I shall confine my remarks as much as possible to their minute internal structure, which can be seen only by examining properly prepared sections with more or less high magnifying powers.

By far the greater part of my observations were made about a dozen years ago. I prepared a number of sections of meteorites, meteoric irons, and other objects which might throw light on the subject, and my very best thanks are due to Prof. Maskelyne for having most kindly allowed me to thoroughly examine the very excellent series of thin sections, which had been prepared for him. During the last ten years my attention has been directed to very different subjects, and I have done little more than collect material for the further and more complete study of meteorites. When I have fully utilised this material I have no doubt that I shall be able to make the subject far more complete, and may find it necessary to modify some of my conclusions. I cannot but feel that very much more remains to be learned, and I should not have attempted to give an account of what I have so far done, if I had not been particularly asked to do so by Mr. Lockyer. At the same time I trust that I shall at all events succeed in showing that the microscopical method of study yields such well marked and important facts, that in some cases the examination of only a single specimen serves to decide between rival theories.

In examining with the naked eye an entire or broken meteorite we see that the original external outline is very irregular, and that it is covered by a crust, usually, but not invariably black, comparatively thin, and quite unlike the main mass inside. This crust is usually dull, but sometimes, as in the Stannern meteorite, bright and shining, like a coating of black varnish. On examining with a microscope a thin section of the meteorite, cut perpendicular to this crust, we see that it is a true black glass filled with small bubbles, and that the contrast between it and the main mass of the meteorite is as complete as possible, and the junction between them sharply defined, except when portions have been injected a short distance between the crystals. We thus have a most complete proof of the conclusion that the black crust was due to the true igneous fusion of the surface under conditions which had little or no influence at a greater depth than 1/100th of an inch. In the case of meteorites of different chemical composition, the black crust has not retained a true glassy character, and is sometimes 1/50th of an inch in thickness, consisting of two very distinct layers, the internal showing particles of iron which have been neither melted nor oxidised and the oxide melted up with the surrounding stony matter. Taking everything into consideration, the microscopical structure of the crust agrees perfectly well with the explanation usually adopted, but rejected by some authors, that it was formed by the fusion of the external surface, and was due to the very rapid heating which takes place when a body moving with planetary velocity rushes into the earth's atmosphere - a heating so rapid that the surface is melted before the heat has time to penetrate beyond a very short distance into the interior of the mass.

When we come to examine the structure of the original interior part of meteorites, as shown by fractured surfaces, we may often see with the naked eye that they are mottled in such a way as to have many of the characters of a brecciated rock, made up of fragments subsequently cemented together and consolidated. Mere rough fractures are, however, very misleading. A much more accurate opinion may be formed from the examination of a smooth flat surface. Facts thus observed led Reichenbach to conclude that meteorites had been formed by the collecting together of the fragments previously separated from one another in comets, and an examination of thin transparent sections with high magnifying powers and improved methods of illumination, proves still more conclusively their brecciated structure. The facts are, however, very complex, and some are not easily explained. Leaving this question for the present, I will endeavour to point out what appears to be the very earliest history of the material, as recorded by the internal structure.
