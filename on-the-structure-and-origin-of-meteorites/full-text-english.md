# On the Structure and Origin of Meteorites.

## Abstract of lecture delivered by H. C. Sorby, F. R. S., _etc._, at the Museum, South Kensington, on March 10, 1877.

The study of meteorites is naturally divisible into several very distinct branches of inquiry. Thus in the first place we may regard them as shooting stars, and observe and discuss their radiant points and their relation to the solar system. This may be called the astronomical aspect of the question. Then, when solid masses fall to the ground, we may study their chemical composition as a whole, or that of the separate mineral constituents; and lastly, we may study their mechanical structure, and apply to this investigation the same methods which have yielded such important results in the case of terrestrial rocks. So much has been written on the astronomical, chemical, and mineralogical aspect of my subject by those far more competent than myself to deal with such questions, that I shall confine my remarks almost entirely to the mechanical structure of meteorites and meteoric irons, and more especially to my own observations, since they will, at all events, have the merit of greater originality and novelty. Time will, however, not permit me to enter into the detail even of this single department of my subject.

In treating this question it appeared to me very desirable to exhibit to you accurate reproductions of the natural objects, and I have therefore had prepared photographs of my original drawings, which we shall endeavour to show by means of the oxyhydrogen lime-light, and I shall modify my lecture to meet the requirements of the case, exhibiting and describing special examples, rather than attempt to give an account of meteorites in general. Moreover, since the time at my disposal is short, and their external characters may be studied to great advantage at the British Museum, I shall confine my remarks as much as possible to their minute internal structure, which can be seen only by examining properly prepared sections with more or less high magnifying powers.

By far the greater part of my observations were made about a dozen years ago. I prepared a number of sections of meteorites, meteoric irons, and other objects which might throw light on the subject, and my very best thanks are due to Prof. Maskelyne for having most kindly allowed me to thoroughly examine the very excellent series of thin sections, which had been prepared for him. During the last ten years my attention has been directed to very different subjects, and I have done little more than collect material for the further and more complete study of meteorites. When I have fully utilised this material I have no doubt that I shall be able to make the subject far more complete, and may find it necessary to modify some of my conclusions. I cannot but feel that very much more remains to be learned, and I should not have attempted to give an account of what I have so far done, if I had not been particularly asked to do so by Mr. Lockyer. At the same time I trust that I shall at all events succeed in showing that the microscopical method of study yields such well marked and important facts, that in some cases the examination of only a single specimen serves to decide between rival theories.

In examining with the naked eye an entire or broken meteorite we see that the original external outline is very irregular, and that it is covered by a crust, usually, but not invariably black, comparatively thin, and quite unlike the main mass inside. This crust is usually dull, but sometimes, as in the Stannern meteorite, bright and shining, like a coating of black varnish. On examining with a microscope a thin section of the meteorite, cut perpendicular to this crust, we see that it is a true black glass filled with small bubbles, and that the contrast between it and the main mass of the meteorite is as complete as possible, and the junction between them sharply defined, except when portions have been injected a short distance between the crystals. We thus have a most complete proof of the conclusion that the black crust was due to the true igneous fusion of the surface under conditions which had little or no influence at a greater depth than 1/100th of an inch. In the case of meteorites of different chemical composition, the black crust has not retained a true glassy character, and is sometimes 1/50th of an inch in thickness, consisting of two very distinct layers, the internal showing particles of iron which have been neither melted nor oxidised and the oxide melted up with the surrounding stony matter. Taking everything into consideration, the microscopical structure of the crust agrees perfectly well with the explanation usually adopted, but rejected by some authors, that it was formed by the fusion of the external surface, and was due to the very rapid heating which takes place when a body moving with planetary velocity rushes into the earth's atmosphere - a heating so rapid that the surface is melted before the heat has time to penetrate beyond a very short distance into the interior of the mass.

When we come to examine the structure of the original interior part of meteorites, as shown by fractured surfaces, we may often see with the naked eye that they are mottled in such a way as to have many of the characters of a brecciated rock, made up of fragments subsequently cemented together and consolidated. Mere rough fractures are, however, very misleading. A much more accurate opinion may be formed from the examination of a smooth flat surface. Facts thus observed led Reichenbach to conclude that meteorites had been formed by the collecting together of the fragments previously separated from one another in comets, and an examination of thin transparent sections with high magnifying powers and improved methods of illumination, proves still more conclusively their brecciated structure. The facts are, however, very complex, and some are not easily explained. Leaving this question for the present, I will endeavour to point out what appears to be the very earliest history of the material, as recorded by the internal structure.

It is now nearly twenty years since I first showed that the manner of formation of minerals and rocks may be learned from their microscopical structure. I showed that when crystals are formed by deposition from water or from a mass of melted rock, they often catch up portions of this water or melted stone, which can now be seen as cavities containing fluid or glass. We may thus distinguish between crystalline minerals formed by purely aqueous or by purely igneous process; for example, between minerals in veins and minerals in volcanic lavas. In studying meteorites it appeared to me desirable, in the first place, to ascertain whether the crystalline minerals found in them were originally formed by deposition from water or from a melted stony material analogous to the slags of our furnace or the lava of volcanoes. One of the most common minerals in meteorites is olivine, and when met with in volcanic lavas this mineral usually contains only a few and small glass cavities in comparision with those seen in such minerals as augite. The crystals in meteorites are, moreover, only small, and thus the difficulty of the question is considerably increased. However, by careful examination with high magnifying power, I found well-marked glass-cavities, with perfectly fixed bubles, the inclosed glass being sometimes of brown colour and having deposited crystals. On the contrary I have never been able to detect any trace of fluid-cavities, with moving bubbles, and therefore it is very probable, if not absolutely certain, that the crystalline minerals were chiefly formed by an igneous process, like those in lava, and analogous volcanic rocks. These researches require a magnifying power of 400 or 600 linear.

Passing from the structure of the individual crystals to that of the aggregate, we find that in some cases we have a structure in every respect analogous to that of erupted lavas, though even then there are very curious differences in detail. By methods like those adopted by Daubrée, there ought to be no more difficulty in artificially imitating the structure of such meteorites than in imitating that of our ordinary volcanic rocks. It is, however, doubtful whether meteorites of any considerable size uniformly possess this structure. The best examples I have seen are only fragments inclosed in the general mass of the Petersburg meteorite, which, like many others, has exactly the same kind of structure as that of consolidated volcanic tuff or ashes. This is well shown by the Bialystock meteorite, which is a mass of broken crystals and more complex fragments scattered promiscuously through a finer-grained consolidated dust-like ash.

Passing from this group of meteorites, which are more or less analogous to some of our terrestrial volcanic rocks, we must now consider the more common varieties, which are chiefly composed of olivine and other allied minerals. The Mezö Madaras meteorite is an excellent illustration, since the outline of the fragments is well seen, on account of the surrounding consolidated fine material being of dark colour. In it we see more or less irregular spherical and very irregular fragments scattered promiscuously in a dark highly consolidated fine-grained base. By far the larger part of these particles do not either by their outline or internal structure furnish any positive information respecting the manner in which they were formed, but careful examination of this and other analogous meteorites, has enabled me to find that the form and structure of many of the grains is totally unlike that of any I have ever seen in terrestrial rocks, and points to very special physical conditions. Thus some are almost spherical drops of _true glass_ in the midst of which crystals have been formed, sometimes scattered promiscuously, and sometimes deposited on the external surface, radiating inwardly; they are, in fact, partially devitrified globules of glass, exactly similar to some artificial blow-pipe beads.

As is well known, glassy particles are sometimes given off from terrestrial volcanoes, but on entering the atmosphere they are immediately solidified and remain as mere fibres, like _Pele's hair_, or as more or less irregular laminae, like pumice dust. The nearest approach to the globules in meteorites is met with in some artificial products. By directing a strong blast of hot air or steam into melted glassy furnace slag, it is blown into spray, and usually gives rise to pear-shaped globules, each having a long hair-like tail, which is formed because the surrounding air is too cold to retain the slag in a state of perfect fluidity. Very often the fibres are the chief product. I have never observed any such fibres in meteorites. If the slag be hot enough, some spheres are formed without tails, analogous to those characteristic of meteorites. The formation of such alone could not apparently occur unless the spray were blown into an atmosphere heated up to near the point of fusion, so that the glass might remain fluid until collected into globules. The retention of a true vitreous condition in such fused stony material would depend on both the chemical composition and the rate of cooling, and its permanent retention would in any case be impossible if the original glassy globule were afterwards kept for a long time at a temperature somewhat under that of fusion. The combination of all these conditions may very well be looked upon as unusual, and we may thus explain why grains containing true glass are comparatively very rare; but though rare they point out what was the origin of many others. In by far the greater number of cases the general basis has been completely divitrified, and the larger crystals are surrounded by a fine-grained stony mass. Other grains occur with a fan-shaped arrangement of crystalline needles, which an uncautious, non-microscopical observer might confound with simple concretions. They have, however, a structure entirely different from any concretions met with in terrestrial rocks, as for example that of oolitic grains. In them we often see a well-marked nucleus, on which radiating crystals have been deposited equally on all sides, and the external form is manifestly due to the growth of these crystals. On the contrary the grains in meteorites now under consideration have an external form _independent of the crystals_, which do not radiate from the centre, but from one or more places on the surface. They have, indeed, a structure absolutely identical with that of some artificial blowpipe beads which become crystalline on cooling. With a little care these can be made to crystallise from one point, and then the crystals shoot out from that point in a fan-shaped bundle, until the whole bead is altered. In this case we clearly see that the form of the bead was due to fusion, and existed prior to the formation of the crystals. The general structure of both these and the previously described spherical grains also shows that their rounded shape was not due to mechanical wearing. Moreover, melted globules with well-defined outline could not be formed in a mass of rock pressing against them on all sides, and I therefore argue that some at least of the constituent particles of meteorites were originally detached glassy globules, like drops of fiery rain.

Another remarkable character in the constituent particles of meteorites is that they are often mere fragments, although the entire body before being broken may originally have been only one-fortieth or one-fiftieth of an inch in diameter. It appears to me that thus to break such minute particles when they were probably in a separate state, mechanical forces of great intensity would be required. By far the greater number of meteorites have a structure which indicates that this breaking up of the constituents was of very general occurrence.

Assuming then that the particles were originally detached like volcanic ashes, it is quite clear that they were subsequently collected together and consolidated. This more than anything else appears to me a very great difficulty in the way of our adopting Reichenbach's cometary theory. Volcanic ashes are massed together and consolidated into tuff, because they are collected on the ground by the gravitative force of the earth. It appears to me very difficult to understand how in the case of a comet there could be in any part a sufficiently strong gravitative force to collect the dispersed dust into hard stony masses like meteorites.
