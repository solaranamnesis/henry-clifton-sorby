The microscopical study of thin sections of meteorites had led the author to conclude that their earliest condition of which we have evidence was that of igneous fusion, as indicated by the crystals of olivine containing 'glass-cavities,' like those characteristic of the minerals in terrestrial volcanic rocks.
